# Vue.js

- progreesive JS framework for building user interfaces and Single Page Applications (SPAs)
- desgined to be simple, flexible, and incrementally adoptable
- used for projects of all sizes
- reactive data-binding and component-based architecture

## Prerequisites

- JS fundamentals (loops, function, objects, etc)
- events and DOM manipulation
- Fetch API & Basic HTTP
- arrow functions, high-order array methods, destructuring, etc
- Node Package Manager (NPM)

## Asynchronous JavaScript And XML (AJAX)

- set of web technologies
    - used to send and receive data asynchronously
- doesn't interfere with current web page
- generally JSON

AJAX is particularly useful for making requests asynchronously without having to reload the entire webpage:

### `XmlHttpRequest` (XHR) Object

- API in the form of an object
    - properties and methods attached to it
- provided by the browser's JS environment
- methods transfer data between server / client
- can be used with other protocols than HTTP
- can work with data other than XML (JSON, plain text)

There's multiple ways to make AJAX calls, libraries optimize this process:

- jQuery
- Axios
- Superagent
- Fetch API
- Prototype
- Node HTTP

Though we want to focus on making requests via plain JS.
